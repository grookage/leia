## [0.0.1-RC1]

- A versioned schema registry, to register various schemas with all primitive and custom data-types, bound by a

- A RESTful interface and a console to manage the said schemas, to allow for easier integrations
- A client to help serialize and de-serialize the data, at production and consumption levels respectively, with a fluid
  interface that can work with any infrastructure component.
- Supports json to begin with. (Avro and Protobuf shall be accommodated later on)
